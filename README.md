# Hi there!

I am a full-stack Senior Software Engineer from Reading, UK. 🇬🇧

I mainly work with C#, React/React Native, Go and MongoDB, but I've also taken an interest in Elixir and Rust.

I'm still getting started with contributing to open-source, and most of own repos are currently private, so there's not much here yet!
